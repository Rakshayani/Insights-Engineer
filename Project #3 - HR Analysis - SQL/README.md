## Why a Static Dashboard?

In this project, a static dashboard was chosen over an interactive one for simplicity and ease of sharing insights. A static dashboard is suitable when the audience requires a clear and concise presentation of information without the need for interactive exploration. It provides a snapshot of key metrics and trends, making it more straightforward for non-technical stakeholders to understand the HR analytics findings.
