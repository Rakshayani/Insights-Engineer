# Optimizing Sales Strategies: A Comprehensive Analysis of Sales Performance

### by Rakshayani Thyagu

## Project Overview:

This project I aim to analyze and optimize sales performance using a comprehensive dataset spanning the years 2018-2023. The dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/maramsa), forms the foundation for understanding customer behaviour, regional trends, and factors influencing revenue and profit.

In this project, I am looking to answering the following questions:

1. What are the dominant age groups among our customers?
2. Which country or state contributes the most to our overall revenue?
3. What are the top 5 product categories in terms of sales?
4. How does the application of discounts impact net revenue and profit margins?
5. Are there specific months exhibiting higher sales volumes?
6. How well are our marketing strategies performing in terms of ROI?
7. Is there a threshold for discount percentages beyond which profit margins decrease significantly?
8. What pricing strategies can be recommended to maximize overall revenue and profit?

## Project Structure:

1. **Data Cleaning and Transformation:**
   - Standardizing date formats.
   - Handling missing values.
   - Ensuring data consistency and accuracy.
   - **Update:** Adjusted the dataset years from 2011-2016 to 2018-2023 for relevance.
   - **Update:** Included new columns (Total_Price, Discount, Discount_Percentage) for revenue and profit calculations.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Analyzing customer demographics and purchasing patterns.
   - Uncovering regional and seasonal variations in sales.
   - Examining the impact of discounts on revenue and profit.

3. **Sales Performance Metrics:**
   - Calculating KPIs such as ROI and Conversion rate.

4. **Optimization Strategies:**
   - Recommending pricing strategies.
   - Proposing targeted marketing strategies.
