# ASK Phase

**Three questions will guide the future marketing program:**

1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

Moreno has assigned me the first question to answer: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?


**Key tasks:**

- Analyze historical bike usage data to understand how annual members and casual riders differ in their usage patterns.
- Determine factors that influence casual riders' decision to purchase annual memberships.
- Develop recommendations for marketing strategies to convert casual riders into members.

**Key stakeholders:**

Cyclistic marketing team: They will use the findings to design and implement marketing campaigns.
Cyclistic executive team: They will decide whether to approve the recommended marketing program.
Cyclistic riders: Ultimately, the goal is to attract and retain more riders, both casual and annual.
