# Riding the Data Trail: Unveiling Cyclistic's Journey to Speedy Success in Bike-Sharing"

### by Rakshayani Thyagu

## Project Overview:

In this project, I aim to focuse on the first question of a fictional case study provided by Google for its Data Analytics certification: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

**Problem:** Cyclistic, a Chicago-based bike-sharing company, wants to convert casual riders into annual members to increase profitability. The marketing team needs data-driven insights to understand usage patterns and design effective marketing strategies.

**Dataset:**

Historical trip data from Cyclistic (anonymized and ethically sourced via Motivate International Inc.).

**Methodology:**

This project will follow the data analysis process:

Ask: Clearly define the question and objectives.
Prepare: Clean and process the data.
Process: Analyze data using SQL queries and data visualization tools.
Analyze: Identify trends and patterns in usage behavior.
Share: Prepare clear and concise visualizations and reports.
Act: Present findings and recommendations to stakeholders.

**Expected Outcomes:**

-Identify key differences in usage patterns between annual members and casual riders.
-Gain insights into factors influencing the decision to purchase an annual membership.
-Provide data-driven recommendations for the marketing team to develop targeted conversion strategies.

**Contribution:**

I am open to contributions! Feel free to suggest improvements, share alternative approaches, or contribute to refining the analysis.
